        "Rust programmers have the best relationships.They know how to manage lifetimes like pros!",
        "In C we had to code our own bugs. In C++ we can inherit them.",
        "Why don't Rustaceans need garbage collectors? Because they take out their own trash with drop.",
        "Why did the Rust compiler join the marathon? To prove it's fast enough... but it always insists on double-checking everything first!",
        "What do Rust developers do at stand-ups? They just borrow time and return ownership at the end.",

        "Why don't Rust programmers need wallets? Because they never own anything, they just borrow it!",
        "C++ walks into a bar and forgets to pay its tab. Rust walks in and drops its ownership at the door.",
        "In C++, you delete your memory manually. In Rust, the memory deletes you if you misuse it.",
        "C++ lets you have null pointers and then blames you when you dereference them. Rust just says, 'Option or nothing!",
        "C++: 'I'll let you shoot yourself in the foot.'Rust: 'Let me check your gun, your foot, and your intent first.",

        "Rust's compiler holds your hand. C++'s compiler slaps it away and says, 'Figure it out!",
        "C++ makes you memorize everything about the language to avoid pitfalls. Rust just gives you lifelines and says, 'Go be productive.",
